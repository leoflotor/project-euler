# Problem 001

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

	1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Notes on solution

I got the idea on how to solve this problem by [Jeff Culverhouse](https://blog.graystorm.com/2020/07/22/somenumber-of-ways-to-calculate-a-fibonacci-number-in-rust/) in his post on how to calculate Fibonacci numbers using Rust.

I was trying to use a recursive method to cumpute each number and then check if it was even or odd. This method was slow because of the recursive function called each time that did not store the previos value already computed.

One of the solutions proposed by Jeff is using simple memoization to store the previous computed value speeding up the computations considerably.
